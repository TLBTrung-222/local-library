The usage of `app.use(passport.session())` might seem redundant at first glance, but it serves a specific purpose in the authentication process. Let's break this down:

1. express-session middleware:
   `app.use(session({ ... }))` sets up the session middleware. This middleware is responsible for:

    - Creating a session
    - Setting the session ID cookie
    - Retrieving session data from the store (MongoDB in your case)
    - Attaching the session data to `req.session`

2. passport.initialize() middleware:
   `app.use(passport.initialize())` initializes Passport. This sets up Passport to work with Express and prepares it to handle authentication.

3. passport.session() middleware:
   `app.use(passport.session())` is what connects Passport to the session. It's responsible for:
    - Reading the session data
    - Deserializing the user object from the session data
    - Attaching the user object to `req.user`

Here's the key difference:

-   express-session manages the session itself (creating, storing, retrieving)
-   passport.session() uses that session to manage user authentication state

The process works like this:

1. A request comes in with a session cookie
2. express-session middleware retrieves the session data
3. passport.session() middleware takes over:
    - It looks for passport-specific data in the session
    - If found, it uses your `deserializeUser` function to turn that data into a user object
    - It then attaches this user object to `req.user`

So while `express-session` loads the raw session data, `passport.session()` is responsible for interpreting that data in the context of user authentication.

Here's a simplified example of what might happen in the session data:

1. After login, the session might contain:

    ```javascript
    {
      "passport": {
        "user": "12345" // This could be a user ID
      }
    }
    ```

2. When a request comes in, express-session loads this data
3. passport.session() sees the "passport" key in the session
4. It calls your `deserializeUser` function with "12345"
5. Your function fetches the full user object from the database
6. Passport attaches this full user object to `req.user`

Without `passport.session()`, you'd have the session data, but not the convenient `req.user` object that Passport provides.

In summary, while there is some overlap, `express-session` and `passport.session()` work together to provide a complete authentication solution. The former manages the session, while the latter uses that session to manage authentication state.

Would you like me to clarify any part of this explanation further?
